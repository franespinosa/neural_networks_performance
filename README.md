Materials for RCC workshop "Performance Guidelines of Neural Network Models, Part 1

### Abstract
Neural networks are mathematical structures typically used to solve supervised classification problems including images, sounds and speech.  In the past few years, neural networks have gained in popularity due to the emergence of large size databases and the development of computational power of contemporary machines, through the use of GPUs in particular. However, the performance of a neural network is strongly linked to its structure and to the parameter values of the optimization algorithm during its training.  This workshop will cover the fundamental guidelines that assist in understanding and optimizing network performance. 

### Objectives:
During the workshop participants will be able to:
##### *Understand model performance
##### *Check for overfitting
##### *Data dearth dealing
##### *Hyperparameter tuning
##### *Algorithm ensemble

### Level: 
Intermediate
### Duration: 
2.5 hours
### Prerequisites: 
All participants are expected to bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges on.  This workshop assumes participants possess prior programming experience, particularly in Python and Jupyter Notebook. An RCC account is not required
